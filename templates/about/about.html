<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style="font-size:21px;">What is Demand Better?</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Demand Better is a political organisation</strong>; it is <em>not</em> a political party.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>As it stands, we do not believe a path to reform exists because the power dynamics in capitalist society prevent it from existing. As such, there would be no point in it. That&rsquo;s not to say we won&rsquo;t support political parties that offer radical change, just that any success they might have is likely to be short-lived on its own. However, by working to create better conditions for such a party, we hope to, in time, support greater and greater successes for radical politics.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Instead, we are looking for a &lsquo;third way&rsquo; to invoke change, one that stands between political reform and violent revolution. Nonviolent protest is one potential third way, but it alone will not be sufficient. The intention of Demand Better, then, is to create an organisation that is able to work on several fronts to drive the agenda for radical change&mdash;however we must.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>To achieve this, Demand Better will operate at three distinct levels: community, education, and direct action&mdash;or <strong>Connect</strong>, <strong>Learn</strong>, <strong>Act</strong>. First, we will build out a network of <strong>Demanders</strong> who will form the foundation of the organisation&mdash;a community of people who share the desire to create a fairer world. Second, we will work to understand the fundamental nature of the systems that stand in our way and the problems these systems create in our lives, as well as their vulnerabilities. Third, we will exploit these vulnerabilities in a strategic, organised and directed fashion, consistently applying pressure until we are able to move the agenda forward.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><em>To take radical action for the betterment of society</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:right;'>&mdash;Demand Better Mission Statement</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style="font-size:21px;">Why Demand Better?</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Let&rsquo;s face facts: there is significant work to be done before we can say we live in a civilised world. Between intersectional inequalities, climate breakdown, active warzones and resource scarcity, most people face avoidable threats to their wellbeing, and in many cases their lives, on a daily basis.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>This is not a world we are proud of&mdash;it is one we must try desperately to improve. However, those we have collectively chosen to represent us in shaping a better world fail us time and time again. The reason for this is evident. Sooner or later, our representatives are faced with a situation where they must choose between their own interests and those of the people they are elected to represent. Since the political system does not reward dissidents, seldom few choose their constituents, and so the system prevents any meaningful change.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We believe there are only two ways this will change: a global catastrophe, something we hope to avoid entirely, or if we <strong>Demand Better</strong>.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>One hundred and sixty-five years ago, social reformer Frederick Douglass gave his seminal speech, in which he said:</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;'><em>If there is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;'><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify;'><em>This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:justify;'>It is this sentiment that we wish to invoke with Demand Better. We must take matters into our own hands, for nobody can ever truly represent our interests. We must work together to create radical change in the world, else pass it to the next generation with even less time on the clock before the impending climate crisis passes the point of no return. <strong>We must Demand Better</strong>.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style="font-size:21px;">What are The Demands?</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The problems we face are legion. However, we believe they can be organised into three distinct groups, and further, we believe there is a clear hierarchy between these the groups.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>First, we believe <strong>sustainability</strong> is the most important issue of our time. If we were only able to achieve a single goal, creating a truly sustainable planet must be it. Without sustainability, humanity is destined to leap from catastrophic crisis to catastrophic crisis with ever-increasing regularity until we&rsquo;re unable to leap any longer. However, as it stands, creating a sustainable planet relies heavily on addressing the second distinct issue: inequity.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong>Inequity</strong>&mdash;the state of being unfair, unjust, unequal&mdash;is the defining feature of modern society. This takes place most prominently through economic inequalities, but also exists in intersectional oppression via discrimination against race, sex, gender, ability and age. Further, those who sit atop the hierarchy of inequity&mdash;the rich&mdash;are also the ones who disproportionately consume increased resources, actively pursue policies to prevent climate action, and who are least likely to suffer the consequences of climate destabilisation, at least for now. As such, the broadest basis of our actions will be combatting unfairness wherever we can find it.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Finally, the third group of issues relate to <strong>liberty</strong>. Bringing everyone to a reasonably-level playing field is of vital importance, but then prioritising a human-first society that looks to promote the flourishing of human liberty, free from oppression, is our final aim. Yes, we must create a more just world, but we must also create a world where we are not slaves to profit margins, shareholder value and debt. We envision a world in which the human spirit is nurtured, where people are given the necessary components to thrive, and where we can re-connect with the spark of joy we once knew as children&mdash;that should never have been lost.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>These three groups of problems feed into our three key demands:</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;list-style-type: disc;">
        <li style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>By way of radical investment in a green revolution: <strong>we demand a sustainable society</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm;margin-left:36.0pt;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;list-style-type: disc;">
        <li style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>By way of radical economic reform and truly representative democracy: <strong>we demand an equitable society</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<div style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
    <ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;list-style-type: disc;">
        <li style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>By way of radical systemic reform towards human-first systems of governance: <strong>we demand the liberty of all people</strong></li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style="font-size:21px;">How will Demand Better work?</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We are obviously a non-profit organisation. As such&mdash;and considering the limitations of non-profit activities and the fact many of us will be working alongside other commitments&mdash;we will look to develop infrastructure and systems as quickly as we can and then scale. This will take the following format, in three phases:</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>Build systems for storing centralised information and connecting with each other, and build the foundations of the processes through which we will operate (currently underway)</li>
    <li>Connect via an online platform&mdash;DB World&mdash;where we can discuss projects, share/store information relating to projects, share articles to inform and education others, and more</li>
    <li>Scale Demand Better to create a national&mdash;and global&mdash;Solidarity Network between different factions working together, sharing information and ideas, and working together to invoke change on a mass scale</li>
</ol>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Organisationally, we will maintain a totally flat hierarchy&mdash;with a caveat. We seek to create an egalitarian society; therefore, we must first create an egalitarian organisation. After all, if we&rsquo;re unable to create the latter, we have no chance of creating the former. However, while no person will have hierarchical dominion over another, systems of temporary hierarchy will always be necessary to achieve certain organisational goals. These will never be &lsquo;self-appointed&rsquo;, nor will they last longer than the task for which they were set. Further details on this will be ironed out in phase 1 above.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Meetings will take place digitally, for accessibility reasons, however, we will look to establish regional hubs in time where we can meet in person and discuss planned local actions.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><span style="font-size:21px;">Will Demand Better Work?</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:center;'><em>Direct action is, ultimately, the defiant insistence on acting as if one is already free</em></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;text-align:right;'>&mdash;David Graeber</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Direct action, in one form or another, has been behind every single concession of power and progressive societal shift&mdash;outside of war&mdash;since history began. There is no tool for moving society forward that sits above it. From women&rsquo;s rights and civil rights to the LGBTQ+ movement and ending apartheid, direct action works, and there is nothing beyond its reach.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>That said, these battles were rarely easily won, and so we must set our expectations: creating a better world will not be easy, but it is without doubt possible. It will require more than a Saturday afternoon protest every few months and writing a witty article dismantling capitalistic contradictions. It will require strategy, time, effort, money and above all else gritty determination that says: <em>I will not pass this broken world to the next generation without the fight of my life</em>.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We dream of a powerful global community, sharing ideas, supporting one another, and holding those in power accountable to those they are meant to represent</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We dream of a world within a world, where mutual support and solidarity the likes of which we&rsquo;ve never seen before are able to reclaim the narrative from greedy soulless men who cling to power, like a remnant of the old world that just refuses to die.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>We dream of a network of people, working together on passionate projects, having fun, and living their lives, knowing that the community they are a part of represents hope for the future of our species.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Will you be part of it with us?</p>
